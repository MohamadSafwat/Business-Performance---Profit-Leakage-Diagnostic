# Business Performance & Profit Leakage Diagnostic
### Pharmaceutical & Medical Consumables Distribution – Case Study
## Overview
#### This project presents a business performance diagnostic conducted on a pharmaceutical and medical consumables distribution company operating in a highly volatile and margin-sensitive market environment.
#### The objective of the analysis is to identify profit leakage, supplier dependency risks, and purchasing inefficiencies, and to translate data into clear, actionable recommendations that support better executive decision-making.
#### Rather than focusing on reporting or visualization alone, this project is structured as a consulting-style diagnostic, designed to answer why performance looks the way it does and what management can do next.
---

## Business Context
#### Pharmaceutical distribution businesses typically operate under:
- Tight margins
- High supplier dependency
- Volatile pricing and discount structures
- Complex SKU portfolios
- Pressure to maintain availability while minimizing capital lock-up
#### In such environments, small inefficiencies in purchasing decisions, supplier mix, or discount structures can lead to significant profit leakage over time.
#### This project simulates a real-world scenario where management lacks a clear view of:
- Which suppliers truly drive value
- Where margins are eroding
- How purchasing concentration increases operational and negotiation risk
- Which actions would have the highest financial impact
---
## Objectives of the Diagnostic
#### The analysis was designed to answer the following key business questions:
- Where is profit being generated, and where is it being lost?
- Which suppliers contribute most to revenue and profit, and at what risk?
- How concentrated is purchasing, and what exposure does this create?
- Are discounts translating into real margin improvement?
- Which purchasing patterns indicate inefficiency or capital lock-up?
- What actions can management take to improve performance in the short and medium term?
---
## Scope of Analysis
#### The diagnostic evaluates historical purchasing and sales data across multiple dimensions, including:
- Revenue and profit contribution
- Gross and net margin behavior
- Supplier concentration and dependency
- Discount effectiveness
- Purchasing patterns and SKU behavior
#### The analysis is intentionally decision-oriented, prioritizing insights that can influence management actions rather than exhaustive statistical modeling.

## Phases of Analysis
#### Phase 1 – Business Problem Framing
👉 Goal: Define objectives, scope, and align analysis with business goals.
#### Phase 2 – Data Preparation & Quality Check (Pandas)
👉 Goal: Ensure data is clean, accurate, and usable.
#### Phase 3 – Descriptive Analytics (What happened?)
👉 Goal: Summarize historical performance.
#### Phase 4 – Diagnostic Analytics (Why it happened?)
👉 Goal: Explain performance drivers and root causes.
#### Phase 5 – Predictive Analytics (What will happen?)
👉 Goal: Use models & historical data to forecast.
#### Phase 6 – Prescriptive Analytics (What should we do?)
👉 Goal: Recommend optimal actions.

## Key Metrics & Dimensions
#### The following core metrics and perspectives were used throughout the analysis:
- Revenue contribution by supplier
- Gross profit and net profit contribution
- Purchasing concentration ratios
- Discount levels versus realized profitability
- Supplier performance segmentation
- Identification of low-performing or high-risk purchasing patterns
#### These metrics were selected to reflect how executives and owners view performance, not just how analysts describe data.
---
## Key Insights (Summary)
#### The diagnostic highlights several recurring themes commonly seen in distribution businesses:
- A small number of suppliers drive a disproportionate share of purchasing volume, increasing dependency risk.
- High purchasing volume does not always translate into high profitability.
- Discount levels alone are not sufficient indicators of supplier attractiveness.
- Certain SKUs and supplier relationships contribute to margin erosion and capital inefficiency.
- Performance issues are often structural rather than operational, requiring strategic rather than tactical responses.
- Detailed insights and supporting analysis are presented throughout the notebook.
---
## Business Recommendations
#### Based on the findings, the project outlines actionable recommendations, such as:
- Reducing excessive dependency on dominant suppliers to improve negotiation leverage.
- Re-evaluating supplier relationships based on profitability contribution, not volume.
- Identifying and discontinuing low-performing SKUs that lock capital without adequate returns.
- Prioritizing suppliers and items that consistently deliver sustainable margins.
- Using data-driven diagnostics as a recurring management tool rather than a one-time exercise.
#### Recommendations are framed to be practical, measurable, and executable within a real operating environment.
